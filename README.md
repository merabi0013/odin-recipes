Recipes

This project is just to build my HTML chops:
Using main elements (Listed tags below and inside is content):
html -> head, body;
head -> title, meta;
body -> (h1-h6, p) -> strong, em; (ul, ol) -> li;

Attributes for specific tags (followed after tag-name in the opening tag):
(For any tag) -> lang;
meta -> charset;
a -> href;

links to other folders or websites (Relative and Absolute):
<a href=(Specific link) > (Content for Appearance on website) </a>

inserting Image in website (Exceptional Element which doesn't need closing tag. <img /> is possible, which comes from HTML 4 and older versions):
<img src="" alt="">
